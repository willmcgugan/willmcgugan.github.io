Big tech may have other ideas, but to my mind the career progression of software developers goes something like this: junior developer, senior developer, the grave.

Assuming a software developer has a pulse, what sets apart a junior from a senior developer? It's not age exactly. Developers aren't like cheese or wine. It takes more than time to mature a junior developer into a full-bodied and robust senior developer. So perhaps these terms aren't apt at all. And yet there are still two broad categories of developer. You start out as the first and transition to the second some time later.
