I live in Edinburgh, Scotland with my wife Ellen.
I'm a software engineer, which is a grandiose term for "code monkey".

If you know me it is most likely through my work in tech, particularly in the Python programming language community.

I don't want this blog to be exclusively about tech.
I plan on writing on a variety of topics.
Very few of which I'm any kind of expert in.
So be warned--this blog will be opinion heavy.
