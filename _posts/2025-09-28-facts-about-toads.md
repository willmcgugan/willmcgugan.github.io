### Toads are frogs

Toads are a *common name* given to certain species of frog, which are characterized by dry leathery skin, short legs, and a bumps on their back.
But "toad" is not a biological classification; two toads of different species may not be more closely related that a frog and a toad.
A possible exception would be the Bufonidae family in which all members are known as toads (although some may also be called frogs).

### Toads are long lived

Toads can be surprisingly long lived, reaching 10-12 years in the wild. While others have been recorded living 30 years in captivity.

### Toad has Agent Client Protocol support

The universal agentic coding application currently known as Toad has added support for [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/overview/introduction), developed by [Zed industries](https://zed.dev/).

Toad now provides an alternative terminal-based front-end to Gemini CLI, and Claude CLI, with no flicker and a greatly enhanced User Interface.
