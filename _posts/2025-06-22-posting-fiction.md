I've always wanted to write fiction, but there have always been more urgent things I felt a needed to do.
And when I did find the time, I ended up staring at a blank page or getting distracted by social media.

One of my goals in taking a year's sabbatical is to try and nurture any skill in writing that I may have.
I plan on sharing that work here.
There is something about sharing your work, even on an an obscure blog like this, that makes it feel real.
Sharing will also help me feel like I am taking it seriously.

Consider posts with the fiction tag as snapshots of my writing journey, not complete works.
I will likely keep working on anything I post, but I won't go back and update anything.

Hopefully by the end of the year I'll know if I have a hope of publishing a novel, or I should just stick to being a code monkey.

Be warned though, if you read any of this, it will be speculative fiction with a touch of horror.
I'm sure that's not to everyone's taste!
