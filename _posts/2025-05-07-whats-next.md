Some years ago I had the opportunity to work fulltime on [project of mine](https://github.com/textualize/textual).
This was at a time where I fully intended to take a year off, but being able to make a living off a project of your own creation is something software engineers dream of.
Working on [Textualize](https://www.textualize.io/) has been a blast, but it has come to an end.
Perhaps not in the way I would have liked, but I am satisfied I have contributed something awesome to the tech community.

So it's back to plan A: taking a year off.
I plan on using this time to focus on my health--something I haven't prioritized while working as a CEO / Founder of a startup.

I'm not someone who can stay still for long.
I need to keep my mind occupied, and that means I need a project.
What form that project will take, I'm not 100% certain, but I do have a few ideas.
Some of them aren't even tech related.

Of course I may revert to form. If an tech idea comes along that I feel needs to be built, I may feel compelled to work on it.
Code monkey see, code monkey do.

All I can say for certain is that I would like to write more.
Writing scratches many of the same itches as software development, and it is a skill I'd like to nurture.
